     * ✅ What is Regular Expression (Regex) in Java?
     * Regex is a powerful tool to match, search, extract, or replace patterns in a string.
     *
     * In Java, regex is supported through:
     *      Pattern class – to define a pattern
     *      Matcher class – to search the pattern
     *

     * Matcher Class - Represent regex engine perform matches
