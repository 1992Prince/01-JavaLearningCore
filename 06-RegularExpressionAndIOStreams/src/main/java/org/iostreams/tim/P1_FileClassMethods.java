üîπ NOTES: What We Learned from This Program üîπ

1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Project Root Path:
   - File f = new File("");
   - f.getAbsolutePath() returns the current working directory (i.e., project root).
   - Very useful for Maven-based or IntelliJ projects.

2Ô∏è‚É£ File Paths Are Relative to Project Directory:
   - When you write: new File("root.txt"), it checks for root.txt in the project‚Äôs root folder.
   - No need to give full OS-level path like D:/... or C:/...

3Ô∏è‚É£ Checking for Files in Subdirectories:
   - new File("files/file1.txt") checks in a folder named 'files' inside the project.
   - You can use "/" to access subfolders. It‚Äôs cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Absolute Path:
   - Even if you give a relative path to File, you can call .getAbsolutePath() to get the full path.
   - Useful for debugging, logs, and understanding actual file location.

‚úÖ Conclusion:
   - File class in Java is powerful and simplifies file handling relative to project root.
   - Avoid hardcoding full paths; instead, rely on project-relative paths for portability.
