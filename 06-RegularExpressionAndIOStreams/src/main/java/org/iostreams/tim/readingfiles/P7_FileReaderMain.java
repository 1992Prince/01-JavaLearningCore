         * ‚úÖ What‚Äôs happening step-by-step:
         *
         * 1) int character;
         *      This declares a variable character of type int.
         *      Even though we are reading characters, .read() returns int, not char, so we can check for -1 (end of file).
         *
         * 2) reader.read()
         *      This reads 1 character at a time from the file.
         *      Internally, it returns the Unicode value (as an int) of the next character.
         *      If the end of the file is reached, it returns -1.
         *
         *3) (character = reader.read()) != -1
         *      This is an assignment + condition in one step.
         *      It reads one character, stores it in character, and checks:
         *          üëâ If it's not -1 (meaning not end of file), keep looping.
         *
         * 4) System.out.print((char) character);
         *      The integer character is typecast to a char (i.e. actual letter/number).
         *      It prints the character without newline.
         *      Example: if character = 49, then (char)49 is '1'
         *
         * ‚ùå Why FileReader is inefficient?
         * | Problem                          | Description                                               |
         * | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
         * | ‚ùó Character-by-character reading | Reads one char (2 bytes) at a time. Slow for large files. |
         * | ‚ùó No internal buffer             | Every `.read()` hits the file system.                     |
         * | ‚úÖ BufferedReader recommended     | Uses internal buffer, reads chunks of data = much faster. |
         *
         * // Efficiently reads the file line by line using BufferedReader.
         * // Avoids character-by-character reading for better performance.
