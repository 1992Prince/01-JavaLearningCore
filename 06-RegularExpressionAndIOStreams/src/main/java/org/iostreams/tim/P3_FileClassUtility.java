/*
üîπ STEPS PERFORMED IN THIS PROGRAM üîπ

1Ô∏è‚É£ Entry Point:
   - `main()` method calls `useFile("timdemo.txt")` to work with the file.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating File Object:
   - `File file = new File(fileName);`
   - Represents a file named `timdemo.txt` in the current working directory (project root).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Checking File Existence:
   - `file.exists()` checks whether the file physically exists.

4Ô∏è‚É£ If File Exists:
   - Prints a message that file exists.
   - Deletes the file using `file.delete()`.
   - Updates `fileExists` flag accordingly.

5Ô∏è‚É£ If File Does NOT Exist (either initially or after deletion):
   - Creates a new file using `file.createNewFile();`
   - Prints confirmation.
   - Checks if the file is writable using `file.canWrite()`.
   - If writable, prints a placeholder message: "Would write to file here".

‚úÖ Purpose:
   - Demonstrates how to:
     ‚Ä¢ Check if a file exists
     ‚Ä¢ Delete it if it does
     ‚Ä¢ Create a new one if it doesn't
     ‚Ä¢ Check write permissions before performing I/O operations

üìå Notes:
   - Uses standard `java.io.File` class for file handling.
   - Throws a runtime exception if file creation fails.
   - All operations are done relative to the project directory.
