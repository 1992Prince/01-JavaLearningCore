In Java Set is an interface that extends Collection interface.
A Set is a collection of unique elements, meaning no element can be repeated within Set object.
Sets are typicallly used when you want to store a collection of items,but you only need to keep track of unique items and
you don't care about order in which they are added.

HashSet is most common implementation class of Set and to create Set in java
 Set<String> mySet = new HashSet<>();

 To create Set from existing Collection
 List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();
 Set<String> mySet = new HashSet<>(myList); // this HashSet obj that contains all unique elements of myList

 The elements inside HashSet are stored using hashing mechanisms and hash-table.

 It allows only one null value.

 HashSet class is non-synchronized and is useful for search operations.
 Since HashSet class is non-synchronized, we should not be using it for multi-threading environments.

 If your business logic involves lots of search operation and unique elements then u should use HashSet class.

 #How to retrieve elements from HashSet?
 HashSet doesnot offers a direct method for retrieving objects such as get(KEy key) in HashMap or get(int index) in List.
 The only way to retrieve objects from the HashSet is through iterating the entire HashSet.
 This can be achiveved by using iterator() i.e. for or for-each etc.
