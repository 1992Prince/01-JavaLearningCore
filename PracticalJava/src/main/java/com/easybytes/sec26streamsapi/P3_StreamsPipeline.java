    /*
    Streams Pipeline
    When we work with streams , we set up a pipeline of operations in diff stages as
    mentioned below -
    1. Creating a stream using stream(), parallelStream() or Streams.of() etc.
    2. One or more intermediate operations for transforming initial stream into
       others or filtering etc.
    3. Applying a terminal operation to produce a result.

    In P1 and P2 examples we have seen how to create streams for collection and arrays
    and empty stream using Streams.of() method

    Now we are going to learn about intermediate operations
