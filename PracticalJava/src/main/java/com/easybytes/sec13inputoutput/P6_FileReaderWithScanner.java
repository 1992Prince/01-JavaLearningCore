        In Java, the Scanner class can be used to read the contents of a file.
        Below code creates a File object from the specified file path and
        then passes this File object to the Scanner class.
        This is a common way to initialize a Scanner to read from a file.

        String filepath holds the path to the file
        File file = new File(filepath); creates a File object that represents the file at the given path.

        Can you directly pass the file path to the Scanner class?

        Yes, you can directly pass the file path as a string to the Scanner class to read the file content.
         The Scanner class has a constructor that accepts a string representing the file path.
         Hereâ€™s how you can do it
         String filepath = "D:/Eclipse_Workpace/PracticalJava/src/main/resources/filedata/input1.txt";
         Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File(filepath));

         Alternatively, Java 11 introduced a new constructor for Scanner that directly accepts a Path object:

         import java.nio.file.Path;
         import java.nio.file.Paths;
         import java.util.Scanner;

         String filepath = "D:/Eclipse_Workpace/PracticalJava/src/main/resources/filedata/input1.txt";
         Path path = Paths.get(filepath);
         Scanner scanner = new Scanner(path);

         Both approaches achieve the same result: they initialize a Scanner object that can
         read the contents of the file specified by the path.
