        dog.sleep(); // Dog is sleeping //here sleep overriden method in Dog class will be called

        /**
         * üî∏ Why AnimalUtility class was created?
         * - To demonstrate code reusability and generalization using Upcasting.
         * - The `printName(Animal animal)` method in AnimalUtility can accept any object
         *   that is a subclass of Animal ‚Äî like Dog, Cat, etc.
         *
         * üî∏ How is `printName()` working for both Animal and Dog objects?
         * - Because both are passed as Animal references (even Dog is upcasted to Animal),
         *   and `getName()` is a method defined in Animal, it can be called safely.
         *
         * üî∏ What do we call this?
         * - This is an example of **Upcasting**.
         * - Also demonstrates **Polymorphism**, where one method works for multiple object types.
         *
         * üî∏ Benefits:
         * - Enables code reuse by handling multiple types using a single method.
         * - Reduces code duplication.
         * - Follows OOP principle of **programming to an interface (or supertype)**.
         * - Makes code flexible and easily extendable.

        Cat cat = new Cat();
        cat.setName("Snoopy");
        AnimalUtility.printName(cat); // Snoopy

        /*
        Aboue for Cat we are not creating ref of Animal class then how AnimalUtility printName is priting Snoopy?
        ‚ùì Why this works?
            Kyuki Cat is a subclass of Animal:
            Aur printName() method ka signature kya hai? - Animal
            Toh jab tu cat object ko printName() method mein pass karta hai: - AnimalUtility.printName(cat);

            Java automatically upcast kar deta hai: Animal animal = cat; // ‚úÖ Upcasting ho gaya silently

            Yeh allowed hai, kyunki Cat is-a Animal
