Approach [Refer video for understanding - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh2gTUHL8Hs]

Here we need to perform stack operations using 2 queues operations only
[2 queues is specified in question]

Step1 - So create 2 queues and initialize them in constructor
Step2 - Now in add operation, stack also add elements linear and similarly queue also
        add elements linear,so here we just need to use offer() method of queue
        to add elements

Step3 - in pop operation, stack follow LIFO and queue follows FIFO.
        So here we will iterate our first queue till 2nd last element and add these
        elements into another queue.
        Elements will be added in another queue in same order.
        And then pop out last element and store it in variable
        now assign all queue2 elements into queue1 and return popped element

        Note - here in for loop to avoid confusions instead of using queue1.size, calculate
               this earlier and then keep that variable.
               Bcoz u r iterating same queue and inside loop u will remove elements from it

Step4 - in peek operation, follow steps of pop pattern but instead of popping out
        last element from queue1, just keep it in variable using peek fun and then
        add this also to queue2 so that none element is lost

Step5 - in empty operation - u can directly use isEmpty() method of queue
