Write a function that reverses a string.
The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

    Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
    Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

    Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
    Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]


Analysis
-----------------------

1) Good thing is here we are given array of characters and not actually String
   So we don't need to convert string into array of characters or something.
   This is good for you that you only need to work on array of characters directly.
   But if in interview anyone gives you string and ask you to reverse it then
   first convert that string into arry of characters by using method toCharArray()

2) In question it is specified we need to use same array and make modifications and should
   not use help of any other array.
   Take another array and then copying elemnts from given array from last of array to it,
   will store characters in reverse order . But this solu we don't need to use.

3) logic wch we are gonna use it,

suppose u have below array

    ["h","e","l","l","o"]  => where array have odd elements
idx-  0   1   2   3   4

hume same array ko modify karna hah for reversing it so we can do swappning of first element with
last element logic,
matalab h can be swapped with o
        e can be swapped with l
        l is single so no swap req

e.g. 2 -   [ "p","i","k","a","c", "h"] => where array have even elements
              0   1   2   3   4    5
            p can be swapped with h
            i can be swapped with c
            k can be swapped with a

ğŸ§  approach1:

ab swap karne k lie hum do variables lenge i and j
i we can keep at 0th index and j we can keep at last index of array
now swap i with j and then increment i and decrement j
continue till i < j

and here try to use while loop instead of for loop [but both while or for will work]

lekin Prince u prefer while loop


ğŸ§  approach2:

yaha we will use only 1 variable i and we don't have any j
and j was at last index of array

e.g. [ "p","i","k","a","c", "h"]
        0   1   2   3   4    5

agar i = 0 , arr.length = 6, j = 6-1-i = 5
agar i = 1 , arr.length = 6, j = 6-1-i = 4
agar i = 2 , arr.length = 6, j = 6-1-i = 3

here also u can use for loop or while loop but make sure to use condition i<j
