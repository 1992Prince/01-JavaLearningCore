Optimal Approach
------------------

like find square root of number x
and x is less than 2 then sqr root of x will be x i.e.
     0 square root - 0
     1 square root - 1

	 but if x >= 2 then square root of it will be less than or equal to x/2

     4 square root - 2
	 9 square root - 3
	 16 square root - 4
	 25 square root - 5

	 so if number is >=2 then square root will never exceed x/2

	 conclusion - if x is less than < 2 then square root of x will be x/2
				  but
				  if x is >=2 then square root of x will lie b/w [2 and x/2]
				  so for binary search we got range is [2 to x/2] and this is in increasing order


    But for perfect square no it will work wihout any issues but for other numbers like 8, 5,6 etc..
	return end value[show one example for non perfect numbers]
