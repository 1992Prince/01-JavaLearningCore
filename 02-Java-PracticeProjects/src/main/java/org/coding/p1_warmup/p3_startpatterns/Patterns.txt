NOTE -
Before starting remember in printing star pattern we are gonna use mostly 2 nested for loops

    outer for loop is for printing no of rows for stars like below in Pattern1, 4 rows are there
    that will be printed via outer for loop

    and

    inner for loop is for printing no of stars in each row

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pattern1

* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *

Approach -
Here we can see 4 rows of stars are there so we need to iterate 4 times in outer for loop and
in each row we are printing 4 stars so inner for loop will be iterated 4 times

Inner loop is printing all 4 stars in same row so we need to make sure after printing first star
it should not come to next line and once all 4 stars are printed in same line then
break the line

Also I will give one space between stars, if u don't want then u can remove it and then your
star pattern wll look like

and for both for loops, I will start i and j variables from 1 till <=4


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pattern2

*
* *
* * *
* * * *

We can see above
we have 4 rows of stars so outer for loop will iterate from i -> 1 to 4
and
in each row we have that no of stars like
first row have 1 star
second row have 2 stars
third row have 3 stars
fourth row have 4 stars

so our logic will be
iterate outer for loop from i-> 1 to 4 and then
ierate inner for loop from j -> 1 to <=i


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pattern3

1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5

here we have 5 rows, so our outer loop will iterate 5 times
Remember printing stars or num is done by inner loop
so don't worry about if * is printing or same num is geeting printed in each row
outer loop don't print anything, so just see no of rows we need to print either num or star ,
we need to iterate it that no of times and so
here our outer loop will iterate 5 no of times

Now analyse each row is getting printed 1,2,3 or some num instead of stars
first row is printing till 1 num
second row is printing till 2 num
third row is printing till 3 num

so here we need to print j variable and j should be less or = to i

if we don't use login j <= i and j <=4 then in each row 1 2 3 4 will be printed
wch we don't want

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pattern4

1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

Here we have 5 rows so our outer loop will be iterated 5 no of times

and in each row we have that no of numbers printed so again we will use logic
j<=i for inner loop

but here we are printing same number instead of 1 2 3 in increasing order i.e.
for first row , 1 is printed
for second row, 2 2 is printed
for third row, 3 3 3 is printed

and our j is changing in every iteration but our i is same so this time we
will print i instead of j

Pattern 5
++++++++++++

1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1


âœ… We need to print a right-angled triangle in reverse order.
ðŸ§  How It Works:

    - rows = 7 â†’ We start from 7 numbers in first row.
    - Outer loop i goes from 7 down to 1 â†’ controls row count.
    - Inner loop j goes from 1 to i â†’ prints numbers.
    - System.out.print() prints on same line, System.out.println() moves to next line.

ðŸ”¥ This is a binary triangle pattern where numbers alternate between 1 and 0 in every row.
